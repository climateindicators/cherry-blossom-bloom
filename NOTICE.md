Files in `data-raw/` are reproduced unmodified from EPA's published per-figure
CSV downloads and are hashed in `data-raw/PROVENANCE.md`. Files in `data/` are
reformatted, not altered: values are preserved as source text byte for byte.
Every transformation is in `R/build_data.R` and is checked by
`tests/test-data.R`.

`narrative.qmd` is EPA's published wording, extracted from the indicator page
archived at `data-raw/source-page.html`.
